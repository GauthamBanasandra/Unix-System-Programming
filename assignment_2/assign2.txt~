1. does umask affect the file creation?
2. can we change umask with in a pgm in 'c'? any system call?
3. can we create an existing file?
   in that case, what permissions come into effect?
4. how big is the file descriptor array?
5. can we open a file twice for reading ?
	in the same process?
	in two different processes of the same user?
	in two different processes of two different users?

6. If it is possible to open the file twice and get two file descriptors fd1 and fd2 and if we read x bytes using fd1 and x bytes using fd2, will they be
    same?
    different?
or will this result in racing?

7. can we
   a) lseek beyond the file?
   b) lseek before the beginning of file?
   c) lseek beyond the end of file and close the file?
      if we do this, will file size change?
   d) lseek beyond the end of file and write n bytes?
   e) if d is allowed, does it affect the file size?
                       does the size indicate the actual
							size occupied?
	f) if e were possible, can we read the file sequentially till the end of file?
   g) if e is allowed, what happens if we copy the file into another?
