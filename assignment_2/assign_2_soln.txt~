1. does umask affect the file creation?
Yes
2. can we change umask with in a pgm in 'c'? any system call?
Yes. Refer - http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Setting-Permissions.html
	The functions in this section are declared in sys/stat.h.

	Function: mode_t umask (mode_t mask)
	Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

	The umask function sets the file creation mask of the current process to mask, and returns the previous value of the file creation mask.

	Here is an example showing how to read the mask with umask without changing it permanently:

	mode_t
	read_umask (void)
	{
	  mode_t mask = umask (0);
	  umask (mask);
	  return mask;
	}
3. can we create an existing file?
   in that case, what permissions come into effect?
Yes. The file gets over-written. umask will have no effect. Permissions of the original file are retained.
4. how big is the file descriptor array?
Around 20.
5. can we open a file twice for reading ?
Yes.
	in the same process?
	Yes.
	in two different processes of the same user?
	Yes.
	in two different processes of two different users?
	Yes.
6. If it is possible to open the file twice and get two file descriptors fd1 and fd2 and if we read x bytes using fd1 and x bytes using fd2, will they be
    same?
    Yes.
    different?
    No.
or will this result in racing?
	This won't result in racing because each file descriptor will have its associated cursor. Also, in both the cases only read is happening, so the file isn't getting modified.
7. can we
   a) lseek beyond the file?
   Yes.
   b) lseek before the beginning of file?
   Yes.
   c) lseek beyond the end of file and close the file?
   Yes.
      if we do this, will file size change?
      No.
   d) lseek beyond the end of file and write n bytes?
   Yes.
   e) if d is allowed, does it affect the file size?
   Yes.
	does the size indicate the actualsize occupied?
	No. The size indicated by ls -l only shows the number of characters that are present in the file.Do ls -ls and the first column
	in the output shows the number of blocks occupied by that file, which is the actual size occupied.
   f) if e were possible, can we read the file sequentially till the end of file?
   Yes.
   g) if e is allowed, what happens if we copy the file into another? (Check this - what is expected?)
   Only permissions are changed.
